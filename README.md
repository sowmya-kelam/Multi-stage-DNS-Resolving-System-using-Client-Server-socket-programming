# socket-programming

In this assignment, you require implementing three C programs, namely Client, Proxy Server (which will
act both as client and server) and DNS Server and they communicate with each other based on TCP
sockets. The aim is to implement a simple 2 stage DNS Resolver System.

Initially, the client will connect to the proxy server using the serverâ€™s TCP port already known to the
client. After successful connection, the client sends a Request Message (Type 1/Type 2) to the proxy
server. The proxy server has a limited cache (assume a cache with three IP to Domain_Name mapping
entries only). After receiving the Request Message, proxy server based on the Request Type (Type
1/Type 2) searches its cache for corresponding match. If match is successful, it will send the response to
the client using a Response Message. Otherwise, the proxy server will connect to the DNS Server using a
TCP port already known to the Proxy server and send a Request Message (same as the client). The DNS
server has a database (say .txt file) with it containing set of Domain_name to IP_Address mappings. Once
the DNS Server receives the Request Message from proxy server, it searches in its file for possible match
and sends a Response Message (Type 3/ Type 4) to the proxy server. On receiving the Response Message
from DNS Server, the proxy server forwards the response back to the client. If the Response Message
type is 3, then the proxy server must update its cache with the fresh information using FIFO scheme.
After each negotiation phase, the TCP connection on both sides should be closed gracefully releasing the
socket resource.
